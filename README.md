Tasker
======

Tasker projects, profiles, and tasks for Android.

Power.prj.xml - A power management project that turns mobile data and autosync on and off automatically to reduce power consumption while the phone is inactive, turns Wifi and Bluetooth off when disconnected for a period of time, and reduces screen brightness and timeout when battery levels get low.

Sleeping.prj.xml - A project that puts the phone into a 'quiet mode' at night when the phone is plugged in and charging.  Quiet mode is overridden when a Favorite contact is calling.

Wallpaper.prj.xml - A project that downloads either a NASA or National Geographic photo of the day.  The user must set the phone's wallpaper to "APOD/apod.jpg" or "NGPOD/ngpod.jpg".
